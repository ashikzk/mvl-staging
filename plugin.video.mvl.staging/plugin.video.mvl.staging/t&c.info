[B]Definitions[/B]

The term “the website” applies to the site (MyVideoLibrary.com), its staff, administration, owners, agents, representatives, suppliers and partners. The term “the user” applies to any website visitor who wishes to use the website once arriving at MyVideoLibrary.com.


[B]Relationship[/B]

The relationship between you (the user) and us (MVL) is that we provide you with access to the referencing material and media contained within our site, which is provided to you on a purely non commercial basis and is, therefore, not that of customer and supplier.


[B]Content[/B]

Other than descriptive material about the movies, MVL does not host, provide, archive, store, or distribute media of any kind, and acts merely as an index (or directory) of media posted by other webmasters on the internet, which is completely outside of our control.

In general, we cannot and do not attempt to control, censor, or block any indexed material that may be considered offensive, abusive, libelous, obnoxious, inaccurate, deceptive, unlawful or otherwise distressing and neither do we accept responsibility for this content or the consequences of such content being made available.  Sometimes we do block referenced material because a third party asserts superior rights or for other legitimate reasons.  We are not responsible for your use of referenced material or your access to referenced material.

Material may be inappropriately described or subject to restrictions such as copyright, licensing and other limitations and it is the sole responsibility of those having access to such material to comply with any or all lawful obligations arising from such material coming into their possession and, thus mitigate any alleged transgression.

All users warrant that they are 18 years of age or older, and, therefore, qualified to enter into this agreement either as an individual or as a corporate entity.

All users undertake to comply with applicable laws and observe the rights inherent in any copyright material whilst upholding the rights of any copyright owner.

All users are advised to use caution, discretion, common sense and personal judgment when using My Video Library.com or any references detailed within the directory and to respect the wishes of others who may value freedom, as consenting adults equal to (or possibly superior to) your own personal preferences.
